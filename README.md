Use "easing" algorithms to ease in and out almost any parameters in your game: position, rotation, color, fade, GUI position, animations, etc.

## Features

* Tween SceneObjects physical parameters: position, rotation, color, alpha
* Use common "easing" algorithms: linear, quadratic, "elastic," "bounce," etc.
* Lots of control of Tweens: repeat, yoyo, reverse, auto-delete, etc.
* "Flipflop" -- New feature for tweening! Reverse direction of Tween but not the ease
* Tween GUI positions, animation rates, or your own variables, too.
